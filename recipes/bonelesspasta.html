        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chefs in Ghoul Town, Nebraska have always been known for their occult and eccentric contributions to the culinary world. Of these tremendous contributions, including Boneless Water, Boneless Pizza, and perhaps most popular Boneless 14-year-old Male Chimpanzee, Boneless Pasta will forever be my personal favorite. This is because Boneless Pasta is not just a meal. It is not merely a combination of fats, lipids, carbohydrates, and all of those other fun little whats-it-dos. Rather, Boneless Pasta is more accurately described as our world's <em>single most profound entity in existence.</em></p> 
        <p>Since its creation in 1200CE by Howard Ghoulman (who famously asked his friend, unprompted and after a night of heavy cannabis usage, "What if uhh... pasta was like... uh... what if it, like, just didn't have any bones in it?"), Boneless Pasta has shattered preconceived notions of what food should be, what food even is, and whether or not you should be permitted to bring bath towels to the beach. The famous dog-walker Seymour Simmons once said that "Boneless Pasta is at least seven times more significant than the invention of the transistor." And there you have it. Without further ado, I present to you, Boneless Pasta! </p>
