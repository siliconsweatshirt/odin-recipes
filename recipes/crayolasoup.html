        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crayola soup is really quite a horrendous dish. If you have found yourself here, you should probably just avoid this recipe. It's literally just melted crayons. There is no nutritional value here. That's all.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crayons</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Seriously? Fine.</li>
            <li>Melt crayons in a pot</li>
            <li>Pour the obnoxious mess into a bowl or, as I recommend, directly into the trash</li>
            <li>Possibly ask yourself "Why did I do this? Am I really even deserving of <em>love</em>?</li>    
        </ol>
