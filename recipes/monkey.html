        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Monkeys are intrepid, good-natured folk known for their willingness to lend a helping hand to those in need. Despite their exuberant attire and mannerisms, most monkeys are rural-raised country bumpkins who don't know doodly-squat. These creatures are just so loveable and monkey-like that you can't help but squeeze their little cheeks and pat their fuzzy lil' heads.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most well-known monkey amongst average people is the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.</p>
